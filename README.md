### App Description:

**AstroCurve** is a versatile interactive computer application developed in Unreal Engine 4. A user can select various real and highly exaggerated asteroid models of different shapes, and using sliders, a user can adjust the asteroids rotation speed along any axis they choose.  AstroCurve allows people of all ages and education levels to play with an asteroid and it's rotation to explore how the light curve behaves based on its shape and rotation. AstroCurve serves as a spiritual successor to the KillerAsteroids Light Curves web application which has now been shutdown after Adobe Flash went offline in January 2021.
