# When Light Curves Throw us Curve Balls
## An App Developed by Rocketship 27 in Unreal Engine 4.27

Basic App Description:

After pressing start a user will be presented with a library (or list) of choices of  'asteroid' objects (maybe categorized into man-made, real asteroids, basic shapes etc). Users could also upload their own model from a file. (Maybe a user could select multiple objects to compare).

Once inside the app you can also change which object(s) you want.

After model selection is complete a user will be presented with a layout similar to the one I sent you last week. There will be a panel to change various attributes such as rotation speed, rotational phase, albedo/surface reflectance, shape, distance to asteroid (probably can ignore this for our purposes) . Maybe a user may be able to change the rotational axis as well.

The program starts 'frozen' until the user hits 'play'/'animate', the object then starts rotating while the graph of brightness over time is filled out. Maybe the graph can be intractable such that you can see the x and y values highlighted over time. 

The sun is fixed behind the user (maybe make it possible to change the position of the sun)
